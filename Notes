Test doubles:

Dummy - Objects that can be passed around as necessary, but do not have any type of test implementation and should
never be used

Fake - These objects generally have a simplified functional implementation of a particular interface that is adequate
for testing, bot not for production.

Stub - These objects provide implementations with canned answers that are suitable for the test.

Spies - These objects provide implementations that record the values that were passed in so they can be used by the test

Mock - These objects are pre-programmed to expect specific calls and parameters and can throw exceptions when
necessary

TDD best practices:

Always do the next simplest test case
    gradually increase complexity of code
    otherwise you write too much code at once

Descriptive test names
    clear and understable
    unit tests document your code
    test suite should name class or functionality

Keep UT fast
    provide fast feedback
    if takes long time you loose this
    keep console output minimal
    mock any slow collaborator
